The cleanhands system is a Senior Project at the University of Bridgeport. It aims
to determine handwashing time by using vision powered by Artificial Intelligence, rather than motion sensors.

## Why we need your help?

Training Artificial Intelligence models is not only time consuming, but it requires vast ammounts of data.

There is currently no publicly available dataset for handwashing that satisfies our needs.  We need videos
that show the full handwashing experience; from someone approaching the sink, washing their hands, and leaving
the sink.

## Instructions

Follow the instructions to make sure your video is of good quality. THANK YOU!

### Important things to remember

1. Have someone that can record you.

2. Make sure the environment is well lit.

3. You should wash your hands in a regular sink.

4. Only your hands should appear on the video for privacy reasons.

### Recording

Before recording, please watch our samples videos.

Please record one **top-view** video and one **side-view** video.

1. Maintain a **steady** position of the phone. Do not rotate the phone around.

2. Start recording by direct camera on sink.

3. Wait approximately 5 seconds before coming to the sink a.k.a before hands appear in the video.

4. Wash your hand as you will normally do (5-15 sec).

5. Leave the sink.

6. Wait approximately 5 seconds before stopping the recording.

7. Stop recording.
