The cleanhands system is a Senior Project at the University of Bridgeport. It aims
to determine handwashing time by using vision powered by Artificial Intelligence, rather than motion sensors.

## Why we need your help?

We need videos that show the full handwashing experience: someone approaching the sink, washing their hands, and leaving the sink to train an Artificial Intelligence model.

## Sample videos

Please watch the following videos to have an idea of what are we looking for.

### Side view video example
